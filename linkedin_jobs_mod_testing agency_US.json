Additionally, You Will Be Exposed To Working with GoldenGate and LogMiner, you will build state of the art near real time transaction data distribution and replication with a high throughput and low latency. You will actively participate in the state of the art in memory architecture for replication infrastructure. System level programming involving multiple layers, e.g., security, network communication, memory management, across diverse operating systems and databases. Tricky Inter-process/Inter-database communication; Challenging dependency computation for parallel applying of row and table schema changes; Demanding memory management, including auto-tuning of memory usage, caching frequent data, recovery from failure; Self management and diagnosability and automatic performance tuning of a distributed systems. Below is a high-level description of our group. The Enterprise Replication group within the Oracle RDBMS is chartered to deliver the base platform for all of Oracle's logical replication products, including Oracle GoldenGate, Oracle Data Guard Logical, XStream, LogMiner, Oracle AuditVault and Oracle Change Data Capture. Oracle GoldenGate enables real-time, continuous movement of transactional data across operational and analytical business systems. GoldenGate supports heterogeneous replication and real-time information sharing across different operating systems and different database vendors. GoldenGate is the strategic platform for enterprise replication and the future of data integration. GoldenGate is a key technology for moving and synchronizing information in the cloud and making the cloud elastic. GoldenGate offers a REST based Microservices architecture designed from ground-up using industry standard technologies and capable of handling multiple deployments from a single remote web based management console. Oracle Data Guard provides zero data loss full database replication and is the key for zero downtime database upgrade and migration. Oracle XStream, powered by the kernel's LogMiner engine, provides a new and unique way to stream data changes into and out of the Oracle database with high throughput and low latency. XStream has been designed to minimize client/server round trips for optimal performance. Based on an incoming data stream, XStream automatically computes the transactional dependencies in the stream and uses massive parallelism to keep up with ever increasing user workloads from the source database. Future projects include building a highly scalable and reliable platform for deploying Oracle GoldenGate, secure authentication, encryption, obfuscation, a massive parallel apply infrastructure for any database (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server, DB2), zero-downtime application/database upgrades, database consolidations and hardware migrations, extensible infrastructure for supporting additional operating system platforms and database vendors, transforming the core infrastructure using object-oriented design in C++, etc. We have over 400 Oracle GoldenGate customers with thousands of implementations across Fortune 500 companies.
