Our corporate training events usually involve copious amounts of alcohol and firearms ... in that order. This is not a joke, nor is it intended \"to try make us sound like badasses.\" We actually enjoy what we do and we believe that it helps promote the creative process and the business as a whole.

We all get what we need to get done, that's all that matters.You probably ought to read-up about RG Nets before you apply, because if you do apply, you may get a call within a few minutes, yes even on a weekend or late at night... because we are always working.
