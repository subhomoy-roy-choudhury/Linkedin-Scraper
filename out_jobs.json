Our first location was in Folsom, CA and we expanded to an additional salvage operation on Franklin Blvd. in Sacramento in 1982. By 1988 we'd also been doing business on Auburn Blvd. in Citrus Heights and it was there that we opened the BMW motorcycle dealership along with the newly-revived Triumph brand, serving the greater Sacramento area. As our BMW business outgrew the available space in that store, we dropped Triumph motorcycles. Still more growth finally resulted in the move to our current location in Roseville CA in 1999. In 2009 we added Ducati motorcycles and in 2011, we brought back Triumph motorcycles, making us your one-stop shop for premium motorcycle brands!Through the years, one thing as never changed - we're family owned and operated by the Felice/Pine family. We even have employees who've been with us from the very start. If there were ever a shop with a wealth of experience and knowledge, A&S Motorcycles is that place!",
